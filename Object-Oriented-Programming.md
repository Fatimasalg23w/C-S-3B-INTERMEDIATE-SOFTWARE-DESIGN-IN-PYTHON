üß± 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Imagine building with LEGO blocks. Each block is like a small object, and you can build big things by combining them. In OOP, we create "objects" that have data (like a LEGO block's color or shape) and actions (like snapping together). Example: A Dog object can have a name ("Fido") and a method like bark() that makes it bark.

üß© 2. Proper Use of Class and Instance Members and Methods Think of a cookie cutter vs. the cookies. A class is like the cookie cutter ‚Äî it defines the shape. An instance is each cookie made with it. Class members/methods belong to the cutter (shared by all cookies). Instance members/methods belong to each cookie (each one can have different sprinkles!).

class Cookie: flavor = "chocolate" # class member

def __init__(self, shape):
    self.shape = shape  # instance member

def describe(self):
    print(f"A {self.shape}-shaped {self.flavor} cookie!")
üç™ 3. Class vs. Instance Attributes Class attributes are shared by all objects. Instance attributes are unique to each object. Example: All cookies are made of flour (class attribute), but each cookie can have a different shape (instance attribute). Cookie.flavor = "vanilla" # changes flavor for all cookies cookie1.shape = "star" # only changes cookie1

üß† 4. Scope and Namespace Usage Imagine different rooms in a house. Scope is where a name can be used (like only knowing a toy exists in your room). Namespace is like a label on a toy box ‚Äî it helps avoid name confusion. def play(): toy = "ball" # only exists inside this function

print(toy) # Error! toy is not in this scope

üì¶ 5. Modules vs. Classes Modules are like toolboxes. Classes are like blueprints for building things. A module can have many tools (functions, classes). A class is one specific blueprint inside that toolbox.

module: animals.py
class Dog: def bark(self): print("Woof!")

def feed(): print("Feeding time!")

üß™ 6. Instance, Class, and Static Methods Comparison Imagine a school:

Instance method: A student says their name.

Class method: The school says how many students it has.

Static method: A helper that gives advice, not tied to any student or school. class Student: school_name = "Sunny School"

def init(self, name): self.name = name

def say_name(self): # instance method print(self.name)

@classmethod def school(cls): # class method print(cls.school_name)

@staticmethod def greet(): # static method print("Hello!")

üß¨ 7. Deep vs. Shallow Copies (copy() vs. deepcopy()) Imagine copying a drawing.

Shallow copy: You copy the paper, but if the drawing has a sticker, both papers share the same sticker.
Deep copy: You copy everything ‚Äî even the sticker is duplicated. import copy
original = {"drawing": ["sun", "tree"]} shallow = copy.copy(original) deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

‚ûï 8. Operator Overloading Imagine teaching a robot what "+" means. Normally, + adds numbers. But you can teach it to also combine words, or even mix colors! class Color: def init(self, name): self.name = name

def __add__(self, other):
    return Color(self.name + "-" + other.name)
red = Color("Red") blue = Color("Blue") purple = red + blue # "Red-Blue"
