# 🐍 C-S-3B: Intermediate Software Design in Python

Systematic treatment of intermediate computer science concepts through the study of Python object-oriented programming (OOP).

## 📚 Description

This course explores key intermediate programming topics in Python, combining object-oriented design theory with modern development practices. Topics include data structures, functional programming, concurrency, exception handling, and robust design techniques.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Configure a Python development environment for advanced programming.
- Use both instance and class members appropriately in class design.
- Analyze and apply multi-dimensional arrays in Python.
- Design, implement, and test programs using class inheritance/specialization, and explain the "is-a" relationship.
- Demonstrate advanced functional programming techniques.
- Implement guarded code using Python exceptions.
- Represent numbers in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal, and use bitwise logical operators for low-level data processing.
- Understand and use abstract data types and Python collection classes.
- Build end-user programs with event-driven techniques and multithreading for intuitive GUIs.
- Explain what a Python Abstract Base Class (ABC) is and how it is used.
- Describe runtime memory allocation, garbage collection, and type checking models, and compare them with languages like C++ or Java.
- Use Python collections to write efficient and portable applications.
- Perform intermediate file I/O operations in Python.
- Design, implement, test, and debug intermediate-level Python programs using string processing, numeric computation, simple I/O, arrays, and the Python API.
- Solve problems in one or more application areas: mathematics, physics, chemistry, cellular automata, 3D simulation, astronomy, biology, business, internet.
