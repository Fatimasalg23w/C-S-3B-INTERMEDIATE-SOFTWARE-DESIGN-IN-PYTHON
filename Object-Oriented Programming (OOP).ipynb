    "üçì Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for Beginners\n",
    "Welcome! This guide introduces key OOP concepts using relatable examples and beginner-friendly Python code. Whether you're new to programming or just starting with classes and objects, you'll find clear explanations and hands-on exercises here.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß± What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to organize code by modeling real-world things as objects. Each object has attributes (data) and methods (behavior). You define these objects using classes‚Äîlike blueprints for creating things.\n",
    "Real-life analogy:\n",
    "A blueprint for a house defines what every house should have. Each house built from it can have different colors or furniture. In OOP, the blueprint is the class, and each house is an object.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class House:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def open_door(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The {self.color} house's door is now open.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üçì Class and Instance Members and Methods\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "A school has a name (shared by all students). Each student has their own name and grade.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    school_name = \"Tech Academy\"  # Class member\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, grade):\n",
    "        self.name = name           # Instance member\n",
    "        self.grade = grade\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"I'm {self.name} from {self.school_name}, in grade {self.grade}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Ó∑ôÓ∑ö\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Create a Robot class with a class member manufacturer and instance members like model and battery_level.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß¨ Class vs. Instance Attributes\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "All Toyota cars share the brand, but each has its own license plate.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    brand = \"Toyota\"  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, license_plate):\n",
    "        self.license_plate = license_plate  # Instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Make a Player class with a class attribute max_health and instance attribute current_health.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Scope and Namespace Usage\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "Ingredients on the counter are local; pantry items are global. Namespaces are labeled containers to avoid mixing sugar and salt.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "ingredient = \"sugar\"  # Global\n",
    "\n",
    "def bake():\n",
    "    ingredient = \"flour\"  # Local\n",
    "    print(\"Using\", ingredient)\n",
    "\n",
    "bake()\n",
    "print(\"Global ingredient:\", ingredient)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Create nested functions and explore variable visibility. Try using global and nonlocal\n",
    "\n",
    "üì¶ Modules vs. Classes\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "A toolbox (module) contains tools (classes). You grab the tool you need for the job.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# tools.py\n",
    "class Hammer:\n",
    "    def hit(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bang!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# main.py\n",
    "from tools import Hammer\n",
    "my_tool = Hammer()\n",
    "my_tool.hit()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Split a game into modules: player.py, enemy.py, utils.py, and import them into main.py.\n",
    "üß≠ Instance, Class, and Static Methods\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "In a library:\n",
    "- Instance method: checking out a book (specific to you)\n",
    "- Class method: asking about rules (shared)\n",
    "- Static method: calculating late fees (general)\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Library:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_fee(days):\n",
    "        return days * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def rules(cls):\n",
    "        print(\"Library closes at 6 PM.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def checkout(self, book):\n",
    "        print(f\"You checked out {book}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Create a MathTool class with all three method types and test their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß™ Deep vs. Shallow Copies\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "Copying a recipe:\n",
    "- Shallow copy: links to original instructions\n",
    "- Deep copy: copies everything independently\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original = {\"name\": \"Cake\", \"ingredients\": [\"flour\", \"sugar\"]}\n",
    "shallow = copy.copy(original)\n",
    "deep = copy.deepcopy(original)\n",
    "\n",
    "shallow[\"ingredients\"].append(\"eggs\")\n",
    "print(original[\"ingredients\"])  # Also shows \"eggs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Create a nested dictionary for a game character. Modify copies and observe changes.\n",
    "‚ûï Operator Overloading\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "Adding two bags of fruit. You define what + means for your custom objects.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class FruitBag:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, apples):\n",
    "        self.apples = apples\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "        return FruitBag(self.apples + other.apples)\n",
    "\n",
    "bag1 = FruitBag(3)\n",
    "bag2 = FruitBag(5)\n",
    "combined = bag1 + bag2\n",
    "print(combined.apples)  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise:\n",
    "Create a Vector2D class and overload +, -, and == to perform vector math.\n",
